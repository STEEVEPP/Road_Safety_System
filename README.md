# Road_Safety_System
I worked on designing and developing an AI-based safety device aimed at enhancing safety and providing navigational assistance for cyclists on Indian roads. The device utilizes state-of-the-art AI models for object detection and depth estimation to alert cyclists of approaching vehicles from the rear. The models are optimized to run on Nvidia Jetson Orin, an Edge AI device. Cameras mounted at both the front and rear of the bicycle provide the input for the AI model, which detects the vehicles approaching closer to the cyclist and provides an alert.
