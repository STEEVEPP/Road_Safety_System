# Road_Safety_System
  I worked on designing and developing an AI-based safety device aimed at enhancing safety and providing navigational assistance for cyclists on Indian roads. The device utilizes state-of-the-art AI models for object detection and depth estimation to alert cyclists of approaching vehicles from the rear. The models are optimized to run on Nvidia Jetson Orin, an Edge AI device. Cameras mounted at both the front and rear of the bicycle provide the input for the AI model, which detects the vehicles approaching closer to the cyclist and provides an alert.

## Introduction
  Cycling on Indian roads poses unique challenges due to unpredictable traffic dynamics, potholes, and various obstacles. The primary goal of this project was to develop a real-time safety assistant for cyclists, which not only detects approaching vehicles but also estimates their distance and provides relevant alerts.
